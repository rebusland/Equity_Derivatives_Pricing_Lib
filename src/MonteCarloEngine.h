 *	  time a vector of double is filled and passed by the method call)
 *  - On the other hand, the approach based on path observers uses less memory (evaluation is performed
 *	  in a rolling fashion) while requiring a greater execution time (each observer is monitoring the 
 *	  the path as it's created). BUT, the memory usage depends also on the size of the objects performing the path
 *	  observation. It's not guaranteed that in a multithreaded implementation, all computation "fits"
 * 	  in cache. Moreover, vector is efficient in storing and retrieving data positionally.

		 * is being constructed along the way. The observers could then update a quantity of interest in a rolling fashion,
		 * thus without requiring too much memory allocation. Concretely, an example of observer could be an asian fixing
		 * observer, which update a rolling fixing value (e.g. an average or min of stock prices) on its observation dates.
		 * Once an observer has gathered all the information he needs, he declares himself as "completed".
		 * Technical note: pathObservers is a list so that we can remove observers from it as they get "satisfied"
		 * while still preserving iterations.
