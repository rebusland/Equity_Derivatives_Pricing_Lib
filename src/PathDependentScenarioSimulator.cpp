/**
 * A (possibly) clever implementation to decouple payoff logic from path generation,
 * which does not require to return the whole path or a map containing relevant path spots.
 * Basically, a series of path observers are injected which gather all the information they need as the MC path 
 * is being constructed along the way. The observers could then update a quantity of interest in a rolling fashion,
 * thus without requiring too much memory allocation. Concretely, an example of observer could be an asian fixing
 * observer, which update a rolling fixing value (e.g. an average or min of stock prices) on its observation dates.
 * Once an observer has gathered all the information he needs, he declares himself as "completed".
 * Technical note: pathObservers is a set so that we can remove observers from it as they get "satisfied"
 * while still preserving iterations.
